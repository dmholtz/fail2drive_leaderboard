# Contributing to the Fail2Drive Leaderboard

> By submitting to the leaderboard you confirm that your model complies with the [Fail2Drive benchmark rules](https://github.com/autonomousvision/fail2drive#fail2drive-rules): no training on Fail2Drive scenarios; external pretraining is allowed.

## 1. Evaluate

Evaluate your model on the full benchmark using [`slurm_evaluate.py`](https://github.com/autonomousvision/fail2drive/blob/main/slurm_evaluate.py) with the default seeds `1 2 3`:

```bash
python slurm_evaluate.py --agent_file <agent> --agent_config <config> --out_root results/MyMethod
```

The script assigns each route a deterministic traffic manager seed (`route_id % 1000 + 10000 * seed`), which keeps paired Base/Generalization routes comparable across runs. Do not override this logic.

## 2. Compute your score

```bash
python tools/f2d_result_parser.py results/MyMethod --method MyMethod
```

The parser prints a LaTeX row ready to paste into the leaderboard.

> Make sure each seed contains all 200 result JSONs (600 total).

## 3. Open a pull request

Organize your evaluation results into `results/MyMethod/` with one subdirectory per seed (`1/`, `2/`, `3/`), each containing the 200 result JSONs for that seed. Then open a PR including:

- [ ] Your `results/MyMethod/` folder
- [ ] A new row in `f2d_leaderboard.tex` (use the LaTeX row printed by the parser); place it in the section matching your sensor setup (camera / LiDAR-fusion / privileged)
- [ ] A BibTeX entry in `references.bib`, with a key matching the `\cite{...}` in your new row

In the pull request, please provide some information about your model and a link to your paper. We would also appreciate a short note on where your model succeeded and failed, including which scenario categories caused the largest generalization drops, and any notable failure patterns.
